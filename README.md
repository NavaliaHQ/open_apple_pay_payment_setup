# open_apple_pay_payment_setup

A Flutter plugin that opens the **Apple Pay payment setup screen** when Apple Pay is not yet configured on the user's device.

> **Note**: This plugin currently supports **iOS only** and is useful when you need to prompt users to configure Apple Pay before proceeding with a payment flow. It does **not** support Checkout transactions—only Vault (e.g., tokenizing Apple Pay for later use).

---

## Features

- ✅ Opens Apple Pay setup natively
- ✅ Simple Dart interface
- ✅ Custom platform interface with method channel implementation

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Add Dependency

Add this to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  open_apple_pay_payment_setup: ^0.0.1
````

Then run:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

---

### 2. iOS Setup

Make sure your iOS app:

* Has **Apple Pay capability** enabled in Xcode
* Includes a valid **Merchant ID**
* Targets **iOS 11.0+**

You may optionally add supported payment networks to your `Info.plist` if you need fine-tuned control, but this is not required for the setup screen to show.

---

## Usage

```dart
import 'package:open_apple_pay_payment_setup/open_apple_pay_payment_setup.dart';

final setup = OpenApplePayPaymentSetup();

await setup.openPaymentSetup();
```

This will open the native Apple Pay setup flow.

---

## Example

You can run the included example app:

```bash
cd example
flutter run
```

Here's a quick snippet:

```dart
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () async {
    try {
      await OpenApplePayPaymentSetup().openPaymentSetup();
    } catch (e) {
      print('Failed to open Apple Pay setup: $e');
    }
  },
  child: const Text('Open Apple Pay Setup'),
);
```

## Platform Support

| Platform | Supported |
| -------- | --------- |
| iOS      | ✅ Yes     |
| Android  | ❌ No      |
| macOS    | ❌ No      |
| Web      | ❌ No      |

---

## Limitations

* This plugin **only works on iOS**.
* You **must test on a real device**. Apple Pay setup cannot be tested on the simulator.
* This is designed for **Vault** use cases. It does **not** support Apple Pay **Checkout** (e.g., for immediate payments).
* Will throw `MissingPluginException` on unsupported platforms if you don’t guard your calls.
